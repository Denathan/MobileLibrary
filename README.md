## **7# Google Nanodegree Program Project: Inventory App**

**Topic:** Data storage

**Project Description:** Create the data structure for an app that tracks the inventory of a retail store, including current stock and supplier information. In this project, you'll  build out the UI to track the inventory of a retail store.

**What I've learned:**
-   Creating a SQLite table in app
-   Populating that table with new entries
-   Modifying the entries
-   Displaying the contents of the table to users.
-   Storing information in a SQLite database
-   Integrating Androidâ€™s file storage systems into that database
-   Setting up a Content Provider and use it to access a repository of data
-   Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
-   Updating information based on user input
-   Creating intents to other apps using stored information
